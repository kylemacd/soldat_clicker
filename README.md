SoldatClicker for discord!  This script replicates the functionality of ramirez's mIRC clicker script.

Installation for BetterDiscord:
- Copy soldatClicker.plugin.js into your plugin folder.
- Go to plugin settings in BetterDiscord and enable the plugin
- That's it!  Once the gather bot PM's you with the server info, double click on the message and fill in the path to soldat.exe.  Discord will restart and then you can just double click the gather bot message to join servers automatically!

Raw Installation (Not recommended):
- While discord is open, press Ctrl + Shift + I.
- Paste the contents of soldatClicker.plugin.js into this console.
- Run the command "soldatClicker.prototype.start()" in the same console and the plugin should start.
- Once the gather bot PM's you with the server info, double click on the message and fill in the path to soldat.exe.  Discord will restart and then you can just double click the gather bot message to join servers automatically!
